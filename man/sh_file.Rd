Simple feature collection with 6 features and 14 fields:
\describe{
  \item{\code{OBJECTID}}{integer Identifier of the spatial object (one for
  each catchment)}
  \item{\code{HydroID}}{integer Unique catchment identifier}
  \item{\code{NextDownID}}{integer Unique identifier of the catchment to
  which the catchment goes}

  belong}
  \item{\code{JunctionID}}{integer Unique identifier of the catchment to
  which the catchment goes. Note that for the outlet JunctionID == -1}
  \item{\code{AreaSqkm}}{double Area of each catchment}
  \item{\code{DrainAreaS}}{double Drain Area of each catchment}
  \item{\code{Shreve}}{integer Indicates Shreve order, i.e. in headwater = 1;
  at the outlet Shreve = max(Shreve)}
  \item{\code{geometry}}{sfc objects represent the geometry of a single
  feature and contains information about the featureâ€™s coordinates,
  dimension, and type of geometry}
