\title{Nutrient balance based in the application of the Geospatial Regression
Equation returning the diffuse, land retention, point sources}
\usage{
nut_balance(
  catch_data,
  annual_data,
  alpha_p,
  alpha_l,
  sd_coef,
  loc_years,
  atm_coeff = 0.38

}
\arguments{
\item{catch_data}{data frame. Definition of the topological sequence of
catchments.}

\item{annual_data}{data frame. Sources of nutrient for each year and
catchments.}

\item{alpha_p}{numeric. First model parameter, the basin retention
coefficient.}

\item{alpha_l}{numeric. Second model parameter, the river retention
coefficient.}

\item{sd_coef}{numeric. Third model parameter, fraction of domestic diffuse
sources that reaches the stream network.}

\item{loc_years}{integer. Years in which the model should be executed.}

\item{atm_coeff}{numeric. A value for atmospheric attenuation coefficient.}
}
\value{
One object, a data frame with the basin nutrient balance

\description{
Computes the basin nutrient balance.
